From CCFinderX website: AIST CCFinderX is a code-clone detector, which detects code clones (duplicated code fragments) from source files written in Java, C/C++, COBOL, VB, C#. 
CCFinderX is a major version up of CCFinder, and it has been totally re-designed and re-implemented from scratch. Its new design and technologies aim at improving performance, enabling a user-side customization of a preprocessor, and providing an interactive analysis based on metrics.

This project is to help people who wish to run this application on Linux, specially on Arch Linux. It follows the steps described on Nicolas Bettenburg article (http://nicolas-bettenburg.com/?p=290) and also configures CCFinderX GUI (not described there)

This is my first attempt to create an Arch Linux package.
